Extra requirement idea: Create a "share" table which contains the fields "shareID", "photoID", "sharerID". photoID is an ID into the Photo table, and sharerID is an ID into the User table. Then each entry in the FeedList will be a dictionary with an ID and a table. The ID indicates the shareID or photoID we should look for, and the table indicates which table we should look in for that entry.
